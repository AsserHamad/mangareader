Skipping the BS
You only need node installed to begin

### Installation

Mamma Mia reader requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to run.
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```
### Running
In the "public" folder you'll find a "chapters" directory, add folders with the pages inside
>public
  >chapters
    >001
        >page1.jpg
        >page2.jpg
        >...
    >002
        >page1.jpg
        >page2.jpg

The naming conventions do not matter

To run the server run this command in the terminal
```sh
npm start
```
